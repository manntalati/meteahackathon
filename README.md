Encrypted File Transfer


**In what way does your project improve security, and how does it improve our school/life?**

Utilizing encryption for file transmission significantly bolsters the security of people and positively impacts academic and professional spheres. Encryption converts data into an indecipherable format, ensuring only authorized individuals can access the information. This prevents any unauthorized interceptions or breaches by malicious intenders. In educational contexts, encrypted file transfers safeguard sensitive student data, including grades and personal details. Similarly, in workplaces, encryption fortifies the protection of confidential documents like salary records and client information, fostering a secure and reliable environment. By implementing encryption measures, companies and clients gain peace of mind when safeguarding valuable data and can greatly enhance security in academic and professional realms.

**Tell us why you created this project, the goals, successes, and future iterations of it.**

Our project was created to address the growing demand for secure data transfer in light of the expanding realm of computer science. Given the increased prevalence of malicious intenders, we aimed to tackle this issue through encrypted file transfers. Throughout the development process, we successfully achieved our objectives, enabling both senders and receivers to encrypt any desired file. Notable accomplishments include the implementation of a Tkinter-based GUI, facilitating user interaction and secure encryption transmission. Moving forward, we plan to incorporate SMTP libraries to enable direct email transmission from sender to receiver. Additionally, we intend to enhance the system by allowing users to encrypt and send multiple files simultaneously and implementing automated key rotation within the application.
